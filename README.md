Implementation of a convolutional neural network for regression of 14 key facial points using PyTorch.

Skills:

Development of CNN architectures from scratch: selection of layers (convolution, pooling, activation), hyperparameter tuning, integration of regularization methods (BatchNorm, Dropout).

Data processing: normalization, image resizing, augmentation (reflection, rotation) with point coordinate adaptation.

Training optimization: working with optimizers (SGD, Adam), parameter control (learning rate, batch size), model validation, and overfitting prevention.
